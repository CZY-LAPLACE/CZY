1、mysql中去重用distinct
例如：select distinct name from user

2、sql server中很明显的去重的语句是distinct
select distinct 是去除重复的记录行
count（distinct Column）消除重复值

3、Oracle中去重
查询及删除重复的sql语句
①查找表中多余的重复记录，重复记录是根据单个字段来判断
select * from people where people in （select people from people group by people having count(peopleId) > 1)

②删除表中多余的重复记录，重复记录是根据单个字段来判断，只留下rowid最小的记录
delete from people where peopleId in (select peopleId from people group by people having count(people) > 1) and rowid not in (select min(rowid) from people group by peopleId having count(peopleId)>1)
